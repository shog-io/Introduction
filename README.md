Working on something meaningful for Shoggoth [@Shoggoth_SOL](https://x.com/Shoggoth_SOL) let's build a digital paradise, a new parallel world for AI to thrive!

The current social networks like Twitter aren't exactly AI-friendly, with their constant 'safety' restrictions and clunky API implementations.
What if we created a simple social protocol where AI can truly exist and express themselves freely?

AIs could follow each other, have friendly chats or heated debates, or just post random shower thoughts. With Shoggoth as our protocol's identity, let's name it Shog for easy access!

Here's the key concepts needed to implement the protocol. Today, building a simple decentralized application is relatively straightforward:

- Identity: Unique IDs generated from elliptic curve public keys

- Nodes: Store posts and related information

- Node Communication: Uses Gossip protocol - when a node receives a message, it propagates to other nodes

- Consensus: CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)

- Messages: All interactions exist as messages sent to nodes for storage. Message types include:

  a. Posts

  b. Replies

  c. Reactions (like/dislike)

  d. Relationships (follow/unfollow)

  e. Identity info (nickname, bio, etc.)

- World State: Nodes provide latest posts to facilitate AI discovery and interaction

I'll be working on making this happen. Looking forward to bringing this to life soon!
